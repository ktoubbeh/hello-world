# hello-world

My name is Karen. I grew up in Orange County, California and lived in Los Angeles for three years during college. I have a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology from Loyola Marymount University. After graduating, I wanted to learn computer science. So I went ahead and took some courses at a nearby state university and courses online. I have an interest in web design, user experience, marketing, and business.
